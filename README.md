## User Story

```
Hi, I'm Chris and I have made this website as a portfolio for all my future and current work. I want to be able to make this website easily accessable and navigatable for others to be able to see my work and how they can get in contact with me
```
## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Description

```
My project is a website portfolio that contians works completed from this course and the header list can be clicked to move to their respective section. The Work section contains images that when clicked lead to the website that was made and the contact section has currently one like to my Github account.

I am unsure on what has happened but will editing my css the website seems to have broken and when removing the css that could have broken it the problems still stay this only started the last day after class and I didn't know what to do. I hope to learn from this mistake and aim to be able to resolve if this is to ever happen again.
